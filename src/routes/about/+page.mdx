# about

<span class="font-mono text-xs text-uv-text-dim/50">last updated january 2026</span>

hey <span class="text-uv-highlight">@everyone</span>, swapnil here.

i'm a just a nerd who loves building things that look and feel great and or pique my interest in a particular topic.

this website is a living record of my work, projects, musings, curiosities and research. it
will be updated as i progress in my journey. in the very near future, i will also use this
site for collecting articles, videos and bookmarks.

### currently interested in

- Embodied AI & VLA Architectures (language reasoning with robotic control in ROS 2)
- Geometric Computer Vision (6D Object Pose Estimation and 3D scene understanding)
- High-Performance ML Systems
- Cognitive Architectures for Agents (hybrid memory systems using Knowledge Graphs + Vector DBs)
- Declarative Infrastructure (reproducible builds and dev environments with Nix, pixi)
- Reinforcement Learning in agentic systems
- model architectures, pre-training and post-training of LLMs, inference optimizations, RLVR

### currently working on

- an OpenEnv-compliant computer control environment where AI agents can learn to perform desktop tasks, using TRL (Transformers Reinforcement Learning) with GRPO
- training a small language model from scratch
- this website

### not work

- In my free time, i hop on valorant and marvel rivals with my friends
- i also like to indulge in some digital art from time to time
