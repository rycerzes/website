# Happy New Year, legends.

There are honestly so many reasons why this site took forever that I’m struggling to find a starting point. It’s been a masterclass in indecision and the kind of over-engineering that would make a senior architect crashout.

## The Design Paralysis

Designing this portfolio was a massive pain. I can’t even begin to describe the mental gymnastics of having a hundred clashing ideas at once. At its peak, this repository was a graveyard of abandoned branches, each sporting a unique tech stack and a completely different design. It was a three-way battle for my attention that resulted in—you guessed it—absolutely zero progress. Total disaster.

## The ADHD Rabbit Hole (aka The "Shiny Object" Syndrome)

I have a toxic habit of "window shopping" for portfolios. Every time I see a *cool* implementation online, my brain immediately screams, "I need that," and I jot it down in my **Obsidian Vault of Doom and Despair**.

I also treated this site as a dumping ground for every shiny new framework I wanted to touch but didn't have a "real" project for. I went through a chaotic series of "What if?" phases:

1. **Next.js** (The "safe" choice that felt too corporate)
2. **HTMX and Go** (Purely for the "I use Arch btw" vibes)
3. **SvelteKit** (The winner, because I actually enjoy being happy)

## The "Lock In" Moment

Eventually, reality hits. When you're applying for `*nternships`, `j*bs`, and freelance gigs, people actually want to see proof of work. Unironically, a portfolio is the most digestible way to hand over a resume while subtly proving you actually have the skills you claim to have.

So, I stopped spiraling into "feature creep" and finally hit deploy. No more shortcuts—I actually built the thing. Now, when someone asks for my credentials (or my shitposts), I can finally just point them to `rycerz.es` and call it a day.

## The Actual Stack (For the Nerds)

If you're wondering what's actually under the hood of this masterpiece, here’s the breakdown:

| Category | The Tech |
| --- | --- |
| **The Core** | **SvelteKit** + **Svelte 5** (Yes, we’re on that runes hype) |
| **3D Vibes** | **Threlte** (Svelte + Three.js) with some spicy post-processing |
| **Content** | **mdsvex** because writing raw HTML for blog posts is a crime |

> **Note:** If the 3D bits melt your GPU, just know it’s because I spent three days tweaking a single shader instead of finishing the "About Me" section.
